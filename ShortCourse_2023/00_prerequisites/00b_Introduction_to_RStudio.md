# Introduction to RStudio

For those who are new to Rstudio, it would be good to take a few minutes to orient yourself to Rstudio. In addition to this, it would be could to see how to excute R commands in Rstudio. For this, we will make use of the lessons provided by the [Software Carperntry Organization](https://software-carpentry.org/). They have made avialble several short lessons to become comfortable with Rstudio and R [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/). We are specifically interested in the [**Introduction to R and RStudio**](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/01-rstudio-intro/index.html) lesson.
